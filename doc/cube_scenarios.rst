What can I do with the Data Cube?
=================================

Depending on from which direction one inspects the Earth System Data Cube, one can extract well-known data patterns
on which existing analysis methods can be applied. For example,

* investigating the data cube **per spatial pixel**, one can obtain multivariate time series for each
  longitude-latitude pair. These time series can be investigated using established methods of multivariate time series
  analysis, and afterwards the results can be merged onto a global grid again.
* Looking at the data-cube **at single time stamps** will result in geospatial maps for the different observations
  whose properties can be investigated with geostatistical methods.
* It is also possible to perform **univariate spatiotemporal analysis** on single variables extracted from the
  Data Cube.â€¨
* However, the main objective will be to develop **multivariate spatiotemporal analysis**. Hence, the main advantage is
  utilizing the full 4D cube which allows for a holistic view on the data-cube.

This is possible because all variables in the Data Cube will be available on a consistent spatiotemporal grid allowing
for a consistent data pre-processing.

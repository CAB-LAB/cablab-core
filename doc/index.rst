Earth System Data Cube (ESDC)
=============================

The Earth System Data Cube (ESDC) is a multi-variate data set of essential Earth System variables on a common grid and
sharing a common data model. The ESDC also comprises a Data Analytics Toolkit for Julia, Python, and R
to facilitate the exploitation data set and an E-Laboratory, which provides a computing environment to access, analyse
and visualize the data set.

Our goal is to foster a holistic understanding of the Earth System by simplifying the simultaneous and consistent
analysis of big and freely available data sets of geopyhsical variables.
